Day 1 2

> **Now** **let’s** **dive** **in** **deep:**
>
> from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp
>
> We're telling Python:
>
> “Hey, I want to use Scapy — specifically the tools for making ARP
> packets (ARP), Ethernet frames (Ether), and a function to send/receive
> them (srp).”
>
> ARP = creates the "who has this IP?" question
>
> Ether = sets up the "send this question to everyone" part
>
> srp() = sends it out, waits for replies
>
> **def** **arp_scan(subnet="192.168.1.0/24"):**
>
> We're making a **function** called arp_scan that:
>
> Takes one input: a subnet (defaults to your home network range)
>
> Will return a list of IPs that replied
>
> This is how you organize logic to reuse it.
>
> **print(f"\[\*\]** **Scanning** **subnet:** **{subnet}")**
>
> We’re just giving feedback to the user:
>
> “Hey, I’m scanning this range of IPs”
>
> The f"" is an f-string, letting you insert variables inside the
> string.
>
> **arp** **=** **ARP(pdst=subnet)**
>
> We're creating the **ARP** **packet**:

Day 1 3

> pdst = “protocol destination” = IP addresses to ask “Who are you?”
>
> This says:
>
> “I want to know who owns every IP in this subnet.”
>
> **ether** **=** **Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")**
>
> We're making the **Ethernet** **frame** around the ARP packet.
>
> ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is a broadcast address = shout to the whole network.
>
> This line is like saying:
>
> “Wrap my ARP question in a loud envelope so everyone hears it.”
>
> **packet** **=** **ether/arp**
>
> We're stacking layers — this is how Scapy works.
>
> We’re saying:
>
> “Send this Ethernet frame which contains an ARP request inside it.”
>
> This is like nesting letters in an envelope.
>
> **result** **=** **srp(packet,timeout=2,verbose=0)\[0\]**
>
> This is where magic happens:
>
> srp() sends the packet
>
> Waits up to 2 seconds for replies
>
> Doesn’t show any logs (verbose=0 )
>
> It returns a list of (sent, received) pairs

Day 1 4

> → The 0 is just grabbing the first part of that tuple
>
> This is like saying:
>
> “Send out my question. Tell me who responded, and forget about who
> didn’t.”
>
> **hosts** **=** **\[received.psrc** **for** **sent,received** **in**
> **result\]**
>
> This is a **list** **comprehension** — a compact way to build a list.
>
> received.psrc = the IP address of the responder
>
> So this says:
>
> “For every reply, extract the IP address and save it in a list called
> hosts.”
>
> **print(f"\[+\]** **Found** **{len(hosts)}** **active** **hosts.")**
>
> Simple log:
>
> “How many devices replied?”
>
> The \[+\] is a convention in CLI tools — like:
>
> \[+\] = positive result
>
> \[-\] = error
>
> \[\*\] = info
>
> **return** **hosts**
>
> We're sending that list of IPs back to whoever called the arp_scan()
> function.

> **try:**

Day 1 8

>
> **open_ports.append(port)**

Day 1 11

>
> 3\. Use that TTL to **guess** **the** **OS**:

> **pkt** **=** **IP(dst=ip)/ICMP()**
>
> We’re building the packet:

> IP(dst=ip) → destination is the IP we want to ping
>
> /ICMP → we’re attaching an ICMP Echo Request to it
>
> In Scapy, using / stacks layers — this is a complete ping packet now.

> Think of it like:

Day 1 12

> Envelope: IP
>
> Letter inside: ICMP
>
> Sent to: the target IP
>
> **reply** **=** **sr1(pkt,timeout=1,verbose=0)**
>
> We send the packet and wait for a reply.
>
> timeout=1 → wait only 1 second
>
> verbose=0 → don’t show logs
>
> If there’s no response, reply will be None .
>
> **if** **reply:**
>
> If we *did* get a response, we keep going.
>
> If not, we return “No response” (we’ll get to that at the end).
>
> **ttl** **=** **reply.ttl**
>
> We pull the **TTL** value out of the response.

> 🧠 TTL = “How many hops this packet can survive before dying”
>
> But **each** **OS** **sets** **a** **default** **TTL** when it sends a
> packet:
>
> Windows → usually starts at 128
>
> Linux → usually starts at 64
>
> So this value **clues** **us** **in** to what OS the responder is

Day 1 13

> 🧠 **Summary** **in** **Plain** **Words** We build a ping packet
