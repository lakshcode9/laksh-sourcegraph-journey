# laksh-sourcegraph-journey
Logging my full grind to break into security engineering. From noob to Sourcegraph-level. One push at a time 💻🔐
---

## 📅 Day 1: Ground Zero

### ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Installed Python, Git, VS Code
- Set up SSH and GitHub repo (`laksh-sourcegraph-journey`)
- Wrote and ran first script: `hello_security.py`
- Practiced variables, control flow, and functions
- Committed and pushed all code to GitHub

### 💡 What I Learned:
- How to configure a working Python dev environment ( well i already knew but documenting is fun)
- Git basics: add, commit, push, directory navigation
- Python fundamentals and habits (indentation, no semicolons, f-strings)

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- Forgot to save README changes before commit
- Accidentally exited the working directory once
- Realized pasting code ≠ learning it (switched to manual writing)

### 🛠️ How I Fixed Things:
- Took time to slow down and understand the commands
- Rewrote missing commits properly
- Focused on understanding over copying

### 🧠 Mindset Note:
Security is deep tech — but I am all here for it!!
